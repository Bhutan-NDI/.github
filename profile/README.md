# Bhutan National Digital Identity

> **Building a Sovereign Digital Future Rooted in Trust.**

Bhutan NDI is the world's first national identity system built on the principles of **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**. Inspired by the vision of His Majesty the King, we are building a decentralized trust ecosystem that empowers citizens, government, and the private sector to interact securely in a digital-first economy.

### Core Pillars
* **Self-Sovereignty:** Users have total control over their personal data and digital credentials.
* **Privacy by Design:** Utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to share only what is necessary (Need-to-Know basis).
* **Decentralized Trust:** Moving from centralized silos to a distributed ledger architecture to eliminate single points of failure.

### Technical Architecture
We are at the forefront of Web 3.0 implementation for public infrastructure:
* **Blockchain:** Anchored on the distributed ledger for maximum security and decentralization.
* **Standards:** Built using **W3C Verifiable Credentials** and **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**.
* **Protocols:** Implementing **DIDComm** and **Aries Framework** for secure peer-to-peer communication.
